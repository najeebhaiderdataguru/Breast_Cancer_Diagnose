# Breast_Cancer_Diagnose
In this Repository I try to diagnose Breast Cancer via Machine Learning Model
Model Summary
This model predicts the likelihood of breast cancer diagnosis (Malignant or Benign) based on clinical and imaging features derived from a dataset of 569 samples. The model uses advanced supervised learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees, and was trained on labeled data from the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)" dataset. Key characteristics of the model include:

Input Features: 30 numerical features (e.g., mean radius, texture, perimeter, area).
Output: Binary classification (Malignant or Benign).
Evaluation Metrics: Precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy.
Accuracy: >96% on the test dataset.
Usage
Code Example
Hereâ€™s how to use the model for predictions:

python
Copy code
import joblib
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load("breast_cancer_model.pkl")
scaler = joblib.load("scaler.pkl")  # Ensure the data is scaled as per training

# Example input data (30 features)
new_data = pd.DataFrame([[14.5, 20.5, 96.5, 600.4, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.05,
                          0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2,
                          16.5, 22.5, 115.5, 750.4, 0.12, 0.24, 0.34, 0.12, 0.23, 0.07]],
                        columns=[f'feature_{i+1}' for i in range(30)])

# Preprocess the data
new_data_scaled = scaler.transform(new_data)

# Make predictions
prediction = model.predict(new_data_scaled)
print("Prediction:", "Malignant" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Benign")
Inputs and Outputs
Input Shape: A numerical array or DataFrame with 30 features.
Output: A binary value (1 for Malignant, 0 for Benign).
Failures to Be Aware Of
Inputs must match the expected number of features and scaling.
Edge cases with out-of-distribution values may lead to unreliable predictions.
System
This is a standalone machine learning model that can be deployed in healthcare systems or predictive analytics pipelines.

Input Requirements: Numerical feature vectors with 30 columns.
Dependencies: Scikit-learn (joblib for saving/loading models, StandardScaler for preprocessing).
Implementation Requirements
Hardware: Training performed on a mid-tier CPU or GPU-enabled machine (e.g., Intel Core i7 or NVIDIA GTX 1660).
Software:
Python 3.9+
Scikit-learn 1.0+
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib for pre- and post-processing.
Training Time: Less than 5 minutes on a dataset with 569 samples.
Inference Time: Microseconds per sample.
Model Characteristics
Model Initialization
The model was trained from scratch using Scikit-learn's libraries, with hyperparameter optimization for SVM, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree.

# Model Stats
Size: ~1 MB (serialized model and scaler).
Latency: Sub-millisecond predictions for single samples.
Weights: Optimized for high precision and recall.
Layers: Not applicable (non-neural network model).
Additional Details
The model is not pruned or quantized but optimized for compactness.
Differential privacy techniques were not applied.
# Data Overview
Training Data
Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic).
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Preprocessing: Null value removal, feature scaling, and encoding.
Demographic Groups
The dataset represents diverse cases of breast cancer diagnoses. No explicit demographic attributes are present.

# Evaluation Data
Split: 80% training, 20% testing.
The test set mimics the real-world distribution of Malignant and Benign cases.
Evaluation Results
# Summary
Logistic Regression: F1-score = 96%
SVM: F1-score = 96%
Decision Tree: F1-score = 91%
Subgroup Evaluation
Subgroup analysis showed consistent performance across different feature ranges. Extreme outliers may require manual review.

# Fairness
Definition: Equal performance for both classes.
Metric: Balanced F1-score.
Result: No significant bias observed between classes.
Usage Limitations
Sensitive to incorrectly scaled input.
Requires features derived from the same diagnostic process as training data.
Ethics
Considerations: The model aids decision-making but does not replace medical professionals.
Risks: Misclassification could lead to delayed diagnosis or unnecessary treatments.
Mitigations: Always complement predictions with expert reviews and regular model retraining.
